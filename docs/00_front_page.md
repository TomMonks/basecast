# Welcome

`forecast-tools` has been developed to support forecasting education and applied forecasting research.  It is MIT licensed and freely available to practitioners, students and researchers via PyPi.  There is a long term plan to make forecast-tools available via conda-forge.

# Vision for forecast-tools

 1. Deliver high quality reliable code for forecasting education and practice with full documentation and unit testing.
 2. Provide a simple to use pythonic interface that users of `statsmodels` and `sklearn` will recognise.
 3. To improve the quality of Machine Learning time series forecasting and encourage the use of best practice.

# Features:

1. Implementation of classic naive forecast benchmarks such as Naive Forecast 1 along with prediction intervals
2. Implementation of scale-dependent, relative and scaled forecast errors.
3. Rolling forecast origin and sliding window for time series cross validation
4. Built in daily level datasets

## Installation

> `pip install forecast-tools`
